# Dannys_Diner_Challenge
This is Week 1 of SQL Challenge from Danny's Challenges. You can find more information about the challenge [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/)
- In this Challenge, I've analyzed the data using MySQL workbench and various functions such as  Case, CTE's, dense_rank, window functions, row_number etc.
- It was really fun Challenge and worth trying for everyone as it provides a lot of learnings along the journey.
